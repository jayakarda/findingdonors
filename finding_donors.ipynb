    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Decision Trees are used in solving various real-world applications. For example, it can be used to detect             fraudelent financial statements (FFF).\n",
    "    Another example is in the medical field where the diagnosis of a medical condition can be predicted from the           pattern of symptoms, where classes defined by decision tree could either be different clinical subtypes or a           condition, or patients with a condition who should receive different treatments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Advantages:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Easy to Understand and Interpret: Trees can be presented graphically which makes it easier for non-experts\n",
    "      to interpret.\n",
    "    * They work well with both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "    * It performs well with large datasets. Large amounts of data can be analysed in a reasonable time.\n",
    "    * Requires less data preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Limitations:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * They are very non-robust. A small change in the training data can result in a big change in final predictions.\n",
    "    * Decision-tree can create over-complex trees that do not generalize well from the training data.(Overfitting)\n",
    "    * Greedy search: Decision Tree algorithm performs greedy search at every node. They search through only some of         the possibilities in a relatively larger hypothesis space. This limits the scope of trees.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ensemble Methods (Adaboost):\n",
    "\n",
    "   Adaboost, also called Adaptive Boosting is a boosting algorithm where a set of weak learners are combined into a      single strong learner. At each iteration, adaboost changes the sample distribution by modifyting the weights          attached to each of the instances. It increases the weights of the wrongly predicted instances and decreases the      ones of the correctly predicted instances.\n",
    "   AdaBoost can be used to boost the performance of any machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Predictions are made by calculating the weighted average of the weak classifiers.\n",
    "   For a new input instance, each weak learner calculates a predicted value as either +1.0 or -1.0. \n",
    "   The predicted values are weighted by each weak learners stage value. \n",
    "   The prediction for the ensemble model is taken as a the sum of the weighted predictions. \n",
    "   If the sum is positive, then the first class is predicted, if negative the second class is predicted.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Adaboost is used in speech processing and computer vision.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Advantages:\n",
    "   * AdaBoost can achieve great classification results with much less tweaking of parameters or settings.\n",
    "   * AdaBoost can select informative features from a potentially very large feature pool.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Disadvantages:\n",
    "   * AdaBoost can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers. In some problems, however, it can be less susceptible to        the overfitting problem than most learning algorithms. \n",
    "   * Boosting increases the overall complexity of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Support Vector Machines\n",
    " \n",
    "    SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for classification or regression problems. \n",
    "    In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features) with       the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.\n",
    "    Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision surface (or hyperplane).\n",
    "    They are the data points most difficult to classify and have direct bearing on the optimum location\n",
    "    of the decision surface (hyperplane).\n",
    "    SVMs maximize the margin around the separating hyperplane. \n",
    "\n",
    "    SVM has a technique called the kernel trick. These are functions which takes low dimensional input space and           transform it to a higher dimensional space.\n",
    "    It is mostly useful in non-linear separation problem. \n",
    "    Simply put, it does some extremely complex data transformations, then find out the process to separate the data       based on the labels or outputs you’ve defined.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SVM can be used in classification of images.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Advantages:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * SVM is capable of doing both classification and regression. \n",
    "    * It can be used for linear and non-linear data distribution.\n",
    "    * Flexibility in the choice of the form of the threshold\n",
    "    * Robustness towards small number of data points. SVMs provide a good out-of-sample generalization, if the               parameters C and r (in the case of a Gaussian kernel) are appropriately chosen. \n",
    "    * SVMs deliver a unique solution, since the optimality problem is convex.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Disadvantages:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * One of its limitations is speed and size, both in training and testing.\n",
    "    * It is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "    * Computationally expensive\n",

    "The goal is to take an ensemble of multiple algorithms and combine them to create a single strong learner.\n",
    "A weak learner is the one which produces prediction that is slightly better than random guessing vs a strong learner which classifies the data with higher accuracy.\n",
    "At each iteration, adaboost changes the sample distribution by modifyting the weights attached to each of the instances. It increases the weights of the wrongly predicted instances and decreases the ones of the correctly predicted instances.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "1. Take a weak learner such as Decision Tree Classifier. \n",
    "2. Apply it on the given dataset. Say we out of 100 samples, you get 90 correct and 10 incorrect.  \n",
    "3. Reweight or resample the instances in training set so that your learning algorithm now has an error rate of 50%. For example, multiply the wrong ones by 9 for the next iteration. This makes the dataset with 90 correct and 90 incorrect instances.\n",
    "4. Repeat step 2 on the newer dataset. Keep repeating this process, each time producing a new classifier.  \n",
    "5. Stop when you have done this enough times or you get 100% accuracy. Suppose, this gives you, say, 7 different classifiers.  \n",
    "6. To classify in the end, do a poll across all of the learning algorithms you built from Steps 2 through 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost training process selects only those features known to improve the predictive power of the model, hence reducing dimensionality and potentially improving execution time.\n"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
